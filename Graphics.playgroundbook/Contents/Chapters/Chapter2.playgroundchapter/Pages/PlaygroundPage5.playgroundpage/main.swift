# Conclusion
 
In this playground, we learned about computer graphics - from the tiniest part of it, **the pixel**, to a seemingly simple but extremely powerful tool, the **shader**.
 
 Computer graphics as an area of study is, of course, much more dense and complex than what was presented in this playground. Even so, I hope that this Playground was a way for you to be interested in the topic and hopefully search more by yourself. Maybe even make your own shaders!
 
 Thank you for your attention, and until next time!
