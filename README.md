#  Computer Graphics: WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge Submission [Accepted] #

Welcome to the repository of my WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge submission! This was a playground I made with the intent of teaching the basics of computer graphics in an easy to understand, visual and interactive way. Topics covered were:

- Pixels
- Graphic processing by a computer (CPU/GPU differences)
- Shaders

I hope you like this playground, and that it inspires you f you're working towards your own Student Challenge submission!
